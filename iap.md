# Expo IAP Documentation

## Installation in Managed Expo Projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/archive/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](#api-documentation). If the link shows no documentation, this library isn't yet supported in managed workflowsâ€”it's likely awaiting inclusion in a future Expo SDK release.

## Installation in Bare React Native Projects

For bare React Native projects, ensure the [`expo` package is installed and configured](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before proceeding.

### Add the Package to Your npm Dependencies

```bash
npm install expo-iap
```

### Configure for iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the npm package. Since `expo-iap` uses `StoreKit2`, set the `deploymentTarget` to `15.0` or higher in your project configuration.

```json
"ios": {
  "deploymentTarget": "15.0"
}
```

### Configure for Android

No additional configuration is required beyond installing the package, as `expo-iap` leverages Google Play Billing internally.

## IAP Types

`expo-iap` supports the following In-App Purchase types, aligned with platform-specific APIs (Google Play Billing for Android, StoreKit2 for iOS).

### Consumable

- **Description**: Items that are used up after purchase and can be bought again (e.g., in-game currency, consumable boosts).
- **Behavior**: Requires consumption acknowledgment after purchase to allow repurchasing.
- **Platforms**: Supported on both Android and iOS.

### Non-Consumable

- **Description**: One-time purchases that users own permanently (e.g., ad removal, premium features).
- **Behavior**: Supports restoration of previous purchases; cannot be repurchased.
- **Platforms**: Supported on both Android and iOS.

### Subscription

- **Description**: Recurring purchases for ongoing access to content or services (e.g., monthly premium membership).
- **Behavior**: Includes auto-renewing options and restore functionality.
- **Platforms**: Supported on both Android and iOS, with platform-specific subscription details.

## Implementation Notes

### Platform-Uniform Purchase Handling

`expo-iap` now processes transactions directly to `Purchase` or `SubscriptionPurchase` types on both platforms:

- **iOS**: StoreKit 2 transactions are directly mapped to `Purchase`/`SubscriptionPurchase` objects with iOS-specific fields using camelCase naming convention (e.g., `expirationDateIos`).
- **Android**: Google Play Billing purchases are similarly mapped to the same types with Android-specific fields.

This approach eliminates intermediate conversion layers, making the code more maintainable while still providing access to platform-specific details when needed.
